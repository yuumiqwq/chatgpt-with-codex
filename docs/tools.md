# MCP tool reference

This fork exposes sixteen tools by default, including workspace discovery,
task waiting and host capability reporting. Enabling the optional host policy
adds nine tools, for twenty-five total. See [host operations](host-operations.md)
for their configuration and access boundaries.

## `run_task`

Inputs: `workspace_id`, `instruction`, optional `executor` (`"codex" | "dsh"`, default `codex`), and optional Codex-only `model` and `reasoning_effort`.

Starts a supervised task with the selected executor and returns `task_id`. `run_task` is always read-only: Codex uses approval `never`, a read-only sandbox policy, and disabled network access; DSH is pinned read-only per process. Codex validates requested model/reasoning support through `model/list`; DSH rejects either option. An unknown workspace becomes a failed task; it does not grant access to a new path. The executor selection is fixed for the task lifetime and reported honestly in `task_result`.

## `task_result`

Input: `task_id`.

Returns the task state, readiness, fixed `executor`, and current bounded `evidence`. Queued and running tasks have `ready: false`. A successful turn has state `waiting_for_supervisor_review`, `ready: true`, and `review_output`. After acceptance, state is `completed` and the reviewed text is returned as `output`. Failures return a safe `{code,message}` error. An unknown task ID returns `UNKNOWN_TASK`.

Conditional fields:

- `thread_id`: present only for Codex tasks once a real native app-server thread exists. DSH headless has no machine-resumable session seam, so DSH tasks never carry a fabricated `thread_id`.
- `partial_output`: present only when a genuine interrupt produced real partial output (for example, DSH cached partial stdout or the last completed Codex agent message). The task state is still `failed`; `partial_output` is never completed `output` and never appears in `error`.

`evidence` contains bounded command-execution and file-change items. When the existing bounds truncate or evict evidence, explicit markers are returned: strings cut by the size bound end with `[truncated]`, an oversized changes list gains a `[truncated: N additional changes omitted]` entry, and evidence evicted by the total count limit is reported through a synthetic `evidence-drop` item. These markers mean the diagnostic information is incomplete.

## `wait_task`

Inputs: `task_id` and optional `timeout_seconds`, default 25 and range 1–45.
Returns the same view as `task_result` after the task becomes ready or waiting
times out. Timeout/cancellation never interrupts or accepts the task.

## `control_task`

Inputs: `task_id`, `action`, and optional `instruction`.

The actions are state-specific:

- `continue`: while `waiting_for_supervisor_review`, requires a non-empty instruction and preserves the original task access and app-server thread continuity with `thread/resume` for Codex. Ordinary `run_task` stays read-only; native resumed tasks can retain workspace-write. For DSH, `continue` starts a new headless execution; there is no native resume.
- `steer`: while `running`, requires a non-empty instruction and steers the active turn (Codex only).
- `interrupt`: while `running`, interrupts the active turn. When interruption completes, the task ends as `failed`; genuine partial output may be exposed as `partial_output`.
- `accept`: while `waiting_for_supervisor_review`, marks the reviewed output `completed` without starting another turn.

Running generated/refined proposal tasks also accept `interrupt`, and Codex proposal tasks accept `steer`; completed proposal tasks do not accept any action. Invalid actions for the current state return `INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION`. Executor runs have a 15-minute hard deadline; active Codex turns also have a two-minute protocol-inactivity watchdog, reset only by an app-server notification whose `threadId` and `turnId` exactly match the active turn. Other threads, other turns, global notifications, and RPC responses do not reset it. Short Codex RPC calls have a separate 30-second bound. There is no automatic acceptance or persistent task supervision state.

## `bind_project`

Inputs: `project_path`, `confirmation` (must equal `BIND` exactly).

Registers an existing directory inside a configured `project_root` as a read-only managed workspace. The path must already exist, resolve inside an approved root (canonical real-path containment), and not already be registered. Returns the `workspace_id`; registration persists to `<config>.managed-workspaces.json`. A managed workspace does not gain controlled-write permission from binding.

## `create_project`

Inputs: `parent`, `name`, `confirmation` (must equal `CREATE` exactly).

Creates and git-initializes a new single-segment directory inside a configured `project_root` and registers it as a read-only managed workspace. Only `mkdir` and `git init` are performed; the repository is left unborn (no commit) and no files are added. Returns the `workspace_id`; registration persists to `<config>.managed-workspaces.json`.

## `authorize_workspace_write`

Inputs: `workspace_id`, `confirmation` (must equal `AUTHORIZE` exactly).

Grants persistent controlled-write permission to one managed workspace only; manual workspaces remain authoritative through `workspaces.json`. The authorization is persisted first, then applied at runtime. This permission gates only `apply_controlled_patch`; it is not direct-write access and does not change `run_task` (which stays read-only).

## `generate_controlled_patch`

Inputs: `workspace_id`, `change_request`, optional `executor` (`"codex" | "dsh"`, default `codex`), and optional Codex-only `model` and `reasoning_effort`.

Read-only proposal flow available in any registered workspace; no write authorization is required to generate. It verifies that the configured root resolves to the Git top-level and that tracked state and the index are clean (with an existing HEAD, or unborn-repository support for added-file proposals), records and returns `base_head`, and starts a separate read-only proposal task that does not modify files. The proposal and its applied history persist to `<config>.controlled-patches.json`.

## `refine_controlled_patch`

Inputs: `patch_task_id`, `change_request`, optional `executor` (`"codex" | "dsh"`, default `codex`), and optional Codex-only `model` and `reasoning_effort`.

Read-only refinement of a completed controlled-patch proposal: returns a new complete proposal against the same `base_head`, preserving the source proposal. The executor is selected per call and defaults to `codex`; it is not inherited from the parent proposal. Requires the source task to be `completed` and the workspace base to be unchanged. No write authorization is required; it never modifies files.

## `submit_controlled_patch`

Inputs: `workspace_id`, `base_head`, `diff`.

Registers a caller-provided complete unified Git diff as a retained, already-completed read-only proposal. `base_head` must exactly equal the current commit HEAD, and the shared controlled-patch preflight verifies the workspace and diff before registration. No executor or model runs, so `task_result` reports `source: "submitted"` without an executor identity. Submission requires no write authorization; application still requires human review, write permission, exact `APPLY`, and all normal rechecks.

## `apply_controlled_patch`

Inputs: `patch_task_id`, `confirmation`.

The controlled file-application checkpoint. Confirmation must equal `APPLY` exactly, the proposal must be known, completed, and not already applied, and the workspace must hold controlled-write permission (managed `AUTHORIZE` or a manual `allow_write: true` entry). The tool rechecks the canonical Git root, clean tracked state and index, and exact base HEAD (including unborn-base validation) before validating and applying the patch once. It can modify existing tracked regular text files or add an absent ordinary text file from an exact 100644 text diff. A new target must be absent from base HEAD, the current index, and the worktree. It never tests, stages, commits, or pushes.

## `commit_controlled_patch`

Inputs: `patch_task_id`, `message`, `confirmation` (must equal `COMMIT` exactly).

Creates one Git commit containing only an already-`APPLY`ed controlled patch. The patch task must identify a retained controlled proposal that has already been applied; `message` must be non-empty and the confirmation is exact and case-sensitive. The index must start clean, unrelated tracked or staged changes are rejected, and retained patch content is staged exactly. Pre-existing unignored untracked files outside the patch targets are allowed only when Bridge can safely fingerprint them under the workspace lock and match their complete path set and contents at later discrete verification checkpoints; new, removed, modified, replaced, or unsupported special paths fail closed. Existing tracked gitlink worktrees are scan boundaries, so Bridge does not recurse into them with superproject ignore rules. This checking is not continuous monitoring or a filesystem transaction. If Git creates the commit but final recovery-anchor verification fails, the call returns `WORKSPACE_PRECONDITION_FAILED` with HEAD already advanced; Bridge does not reset or rewrite history, and retrying the same proposal fails its original-base-HEAD check without another commit. Patch-added untracked targets remain controlled patch paths, while ignored paths retain their existing semantics and stay outside this snapshot. The commit step is separate from `APPLY`, does not imply any later gate, and never pushes.

## `configure_validation_profile`

Inputs: `workspace_id`, `profile`, `confirmation` (must equal `CONFIGURE` exactly).

Replaces the fixed validation profile for one registered workspace. A profile contains ordered `preparation` and `validation` steps; each step is a non-empty argv array and optional timeout, never a shell string. The profile is persisted in the local `<config>.validation-profiles.json` sidecar. Configuration does not validate a proposal and does not authorize `APPLY` or `COMMIT`.

## `validate_controlled_patch`

Input: `patch_task_id`.

Runs the retained proposal against the workspace validation profile in a temporary detached worktree after the normal controlled-patch preflight. Results are `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `INCOMPLETE`. Validation is optional and on-demand: it neither changes proposal state nor grants write permission, and the detached worktree protects the registered workspace from candidate build artifacts but is not a host-level sandbox. Unborn-base proposals return `INCOMPLETE` with `reason: "unsupported_unborn_base"`.
